  vim-SentenceChopper   *vim-sentencechop* *SentenceChopper* *sentencechop*

===========================================================================
Intro ~

This Vim plug-in furnishes

- an operator mapping gw in normal mode, for example gwip operates on a
  paragraph,
- a mapping gww (and gwgw) in normal mode that operates on a single line,
- a mapping gw that operates on the visual selection, and
- a command *ChopSentences* that operates on given range (equal to the whole
  buffer if unspecified)

that put each sentence onto a single line.

That is, lines are only broken at punctuation marks .?! for better version
control of prose such as markdown, tex or text files.

For best results, ensure that latexindent is installed and the folder that
contains its executable is listed in $PATH (respectively in %PATH% on
Microsoft Windows).
This formatter will also distinguish TeX markup from prose to preserve
syntactic line breaks.

Usage ~

For example, hitting gwip on

>
  Hello! How are you? I'm Fine. And you?
<

turns it into

>
  Hello!
  How are you?
  I'm Fine.
  And you?
<

Configuration ~

The variable *g:punctuation_marks* defines punctuation marks at which sentences
are split up other than '.'; it is by default set to

>
  let g:punctuation_marks = '?!'
<

The variables *g:opening_delimiters* and *g:closing_delimiters* and its
buffer-local analogs define delimiters such as parentheses and quotes;
its global variant default to

>
  let g:opening_delimiters = '[(''"„“«»‚‘‹›'
  let g:closing_delimiters = '])''"“”«»‘’‹›'
<

Its buffer-local variant defaults in Markdown files to

>

  let b:opening_delimiters = g:opening_delimiters . '*_'
  let b:closing_delimiters = g:closing_delimiters . '*_'
<

The global variable *g:latexindent* and its buffer-local analog *b:latexindent*
defines whether latexindent [0] should be used; by default, if available,
latexindent is used in TeX (and pandoc) files only. (That is, `b:latexindent`
is enabled in all buffers of these file types.)

The variable *g:latexindent_options* (and its buffer-local analog *b:latexindent_options*)
defines the command-line options passed to latexindent as listed by latexindent
-h . The buffer-local variable is undefined and the global variable is by
default set to

>
  let g:latexindent_options = ''
<

The variable *g:latexindent_yaml_options* (and its buffer-local analog
*b:latexindent_yaml_options*) defines the documented YAML options passed to
latexindent. The buffer-local variable is undefined and the global variable is
by default set to

>
  let g:latexindent_yaml_options = ''
       \ . 'modifyLineBreaks:items:ItemStartsOnOwnLine: 1' . ','
       \ . 'modifyLineBreaks:environments:'
              \ . 'BeginStartsOnOwnLine: 1' . ';'
              \ . 'BodyStartsOnOwnLine: 1' . ';'
              \ . 'EndStartsOnOwnLine: 1' . ';'
              \ . 'EndFinishesWithLineBreak: 1' . ';'
              \ . 'DBSFinishesWithLineBreak: 1' . ','
       \ . 'modifyLineBreaks:specialBeginEnd:displayMath:'
             \ . 'SpecialBeginStartsOnOwnLine: 1' . ';'
             \ . 'SpecialBodyStartsOnOwnLine: 1' . ';'
             \ . 'SpecialEndStartsOnOwnLine: 1' . ';'
             \ . 'SpecialEndFinishesWithLineBreak: 1' . ','
       \ . 'modifyLineBreaks:specialBeginEnd:displayMathTeX:'
             \ . 'SpecialBeginStartsOnOwnLine: 1' . ';'
             \ . 'SpecialBodyStartsOnOwnLine: 1' . ';'
             \ . 'SpecialEndStartsOnOwnLine: 1' . ';'
             \ . 'SpecialEndFinishesWithLineBreak: 1' . ','
<

For example, to split up sentences also after ; or :  (in addition to .), and
put every sentence in parentheses onto its proper line, add to your vimrc

>
  let g:latexindent_yaml_options = 'modifyLineBreaks:oneSentencePerLine:sentencesEndWith:'
       \ . 'other: \;|\:' . ';'
       \ . 'modifyLineBreaks:oneSentencePerLine:' . 'sentencesFollow:other: "\)"' . ','
       \ . 'modifyLineBreaks:oneSentencePerLine:' . 'sentencesBeginWith:other: [a-z]'
<

Mappings ~

To change mappings, for example, to use zy instead of gw, add the lines

>
  nmap zy *<plug>(ChopSentences)*
  xmap zy *<plug>(ChopSentences)*
<

to your vimrc.

Hints ~

To replace (or delete, or any other operation by Vim) up to the next punctuation mark, say . and ,;:!?, add

>
  onoremap <silent> . :<c-u>call search('\v%([\[(''"„“«»‚‘‹›[:space:]]\|^)%(%(%(%([[:upper:]]{2,}\|[[:upper:]][[:lower:]]{2,}%([\/''`’-][[:upper:]]?[[:lower:]]+)*\|[[:lower:]]+%([\/''`’-][[:lower:]]+)+\|[[:lower:]]{2,}\|[[:digit:]]{3,})[\])''"“”«»‘’‹›[:space:]]?\zs[.,;:!?])))','W')<CR>
<

to your vimrc! Then, for example, hitting "c." will change and "d." delete the
text up to the next punctuation mark. Say "c." turns "That's*it, Sir.",
where "*" stands for the cursor position, into "That's*, Sir".
This can be thought of as a counterpart to Vim's built-in C and D commands
for prose.


To normalize Unicode Homoglyphs, for example, of white spaces and punctuation
marks, before chopping sentences, see the Vim plug-in vim-unicode-homoglyphs
that highlights and normalizes Unicode homoglyphs.
