===========================================================================
Usage ~

This Vim plug-in furnishes the map gw as an operator in normal mode, for
example gwip will format a paragraph, and in visual mode that

- first normalizes Unicode Homoglyphs, and
- then puts each sentence onto a single line.

That is, lines are only broken at punctuation marks .;:?!
Useful, in particular, for better version control of prose such as markdown,
tex or text files.

For example, hitting gwip on
>
  Hello! How are you? Fine; after all.
<
turns it into
>
  Hello!
  How are you?
  Fine;
  after all.
<
